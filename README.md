# CEX
### The Cleaning and EXploration kit for Data Scientist.

I made for my personal preferences based on my personal experiences through data science competitions and projects. This kit has many functions that can be imported to your project easily so you don't have to repeat some process that took long line of code. Feel free to fork and edit based on your personal experience.

The code will be updated if I meet new process that can be simplifed. If you have any suggestion feel free to speak.

Make sure you have the libraries needed installed

<ul>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn</li>
  <li>Seaborn</li>
</ul>
